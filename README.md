## Future Scope:
We plan on taking it a step forward by making it an interactive platform which fulfills the needs of doctors as well as patients to the fullest.
When an appointment would be created a patient would be displayed a graph wherein he can view the timings and the dates on which the doctor(specific) would be free and the request made by the patient would be given to the doctor.
Also after the doctor accepts the invitation a meeting would be held between the two and then the doctor would prescribe the medication and the fees and the patient on handing in the fees would rate the doctor.
For anonymity purposes the name of the patient giving the rating wouldn’t be visible.
Also taking it a step forward we would apply machine learning techniques and implement neural networks to understand patient segments and thereby recommending him doctors which he would need at that moment thereby increasing traffic on our site.

## Conclusion:
We were successful in our mission to create a community and cater their needs and demands at the  earliest by recommending them the best quality doctors available so that trust in a relation between us and the patients could be successfully established.
We were successful in harnessing the power of Django which gave us the admin utility which provides  a much better UI than the traditional command line shell for viewing and editing our databases.Moreover our concepts of joints and order by were further enriched.
